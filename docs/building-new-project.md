# Tutorial: Flakebox in a New Project

In this tutorial we will:

* start a new Rust project from scratch;
* set up Flakebox in it;
* use it to compile our project;
* then cross-compile it;
* introduce some nontrivial C dependencies;
* then compile and cross-compile again;
* and set up a cross-compiling dev shell.

## Please help

It's a laborious task to keep a tutorial like that up to date in an immature project.
If you notice any problems please report them. If you have any questions, please use
community channels to ask for help. Thank you.

## Creating new project

Create a new project:

```
> mkdir flakebox-tutorial
> cd flakebox-tutorial/
```

Since we don't have a dev shell yet, initialize new project using `cargo` from nixpkgs:

```
> git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/dpc/tmp/testcargoinit/.git/
> nix run nixpkgs#cargo -- init
     Created binary (application) package
```

(If the above command doesn't work, probably you need to setup Nix with Flakes enabled).

Initialize Nix Flake inside the project:

```
> nix flake init
wrote: /home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial/flake.nix
```

Commit the results as a good starting point:

```
> git add -A
> git commit -a -m "Empty project"
[master (root-commit) 01e823b] Empty project
 3 files changed, 22 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Cargo.toml
 create mode 100644 flake.nix
 create mode 100644 src/main.rs
```
 
Add `nixpkgs` and `flakebox` as inputs (dependencies) to your flake.
Note that I use `hx` as my text editor, but you can use whatever
you like.

```
> hx flake.nix
> git diff
```

Note: If you're getting errors like:

```
       error: a 'aarch64-darwin' with features {} is required to build '/nix/store/ag23kdyxy0is5w3jj8lplz749bhwgnhw-flakebox-flakebox-ci-yaml-gen.drv', but I am a 'x86_64-linux' with features {benchmark, big-parallel, kvm, nixos-test}
```

it means your `nix` is too old. Use `nix run nixpkgs#nix flake check` instead to run a newest version.
With Nix even tools that are not currently installed are easy to use.

This is the basic setup. It would probably be faster to use a template,
but doing it from scratch doesn't take long and is a steady start.

Now let's bring in the tools we need.

## Setting up Flakebox dev shell

We still don't have even `cargo` for our project, so let's do that next:

```
> hx flake.nix
> git diff
```

```diff
diff --git a/flake.nix b/flake.nix

+        flakeboxLib = flakebox.lib.${system} { };
+      in
+      {
+        devShells = flakeboxLib.mkShells {
+          packages = [ ];
+        };
+      });
 }
```
 
Since that's a bit handful, let me paste the whole content:

```
> cat flake.nix 
```
 
```nix
{
  description = "A very basic flake";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs?ref=nixos-24.05";

    flakebox = {
      url = "github:rustshop/flakebox";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flakebox, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        flakeboxLib = flakebox.lib.${system} { };
      in
      {
        devShells = flakeboxLib.mkShells {
          packages = [ ];
        };
      });
}
```

I've added a `eachDefaultSystem` from `flake-utils`. This is
a common pattern taking care of implementing all outputs from
our Flake on all system architectures.

But the most important part is initializing `flakeboxLib`,
and then using it to create a new `default` `devShell`.

Verify the Nix code is still OK:

```
> nix run nixpkgs#nix flake check
warning: Git tree '/home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial' is dirty
warning: The check omitted these incompatible systems: aarch64-darwin, aarch64-linux, x86_64-darwin
Use '--all-systems' to check all.
```

And if so, enter the new dev shell we created:


```
> nix develop
warning: Git tree '/home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial' is dirty
⚠️  Flakebox files not installed. Call `flakebox install`.
```

It works. Ignore the prompt for now and commit our progress:

```
> git commit -a -m "Flakebox dev shell"
[master eb3ca46] Flakebox dev shell
 2 files changed, 55 insertions(+), 14 deletions(-)
```
 
Now, run the `flakebox install` to install dev shell files into your project:

```
> flakebox install
```

If you see:

```
direnv: error /home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
```

it's because you have `direnv` installed on your system and flakebox enabled support for it. If you allow
it with `direnv allow`, you will automatically enter your dev shell each time you `cd` into your project.

Verify the files installed by `flakebox install`:

```
> git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .config/flakebox/current
	new file:   .config/flakebox/shellHook.sh
	new file:   .config/semgrep.yaml
	new file:   .envrc
	new file:   .github/workflows/flakebox-ci.yml
	new file:   .github/workflows/flakebox-flakehub-publish.yml
	new file:   .rustfmt.toml
	new file:   justfile
	new file:   misc/git-hooks/commit-msg
	new file:   misc/git-hooks/commit-template.txt
	new file:   misc/git-hooks/pre-commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
```

The exact output might differ. As you can see Flakebox installed
and configured all sorts of extra functionality.

See if everything still works be leaving and entering the shell again:

```
> exit
> nix develop
warning: Git tree '/home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial' is dirty
💡 Run 'just' for a list of available 'just ...' helper recipes
```

Commit the changes:

```
> git commit -a -m "Setup flakebox dev shell"
Skipping semgrep check: .config/semgrep.yaml doesn't exist
FAIL  -  first line doesn't match `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`  Setup flakebox dev shell
Please follow conventional commits(https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
Use git commit <args> to fix your commit
```

Oh. It's the dev shell already doing its work. It detected that the commit message does not follow conventional commits.

Fix it and try again:

```
> git commit -a -m "build: Setup flakebox dev shell"
Skipping semgrep check: .config/semgrep.yaml doesn't exist
[main a3cfda7] build: Setup flakebox dev shell
 12 files changed, 483 insertions(+)
# ... skipped for brevity
```

That's better. There's more to Flakebox Dev Shells, but this will do for now.
Let's move to the cool part - building your project with Nix.

## Building Rust code with Flakebox - setup

The easiest and most versatile way to build Rust with Flakebox is using
`flakeboxLib.


```
> git diff
```

+            craneLib = (craneLib'.overrideArgs {
+              pname = "flakebox-tutorial";
+              src = rustSrc;
+            });
+          in
+          rec {
+            workspaceDeps = craneLib.buildWorkspaceDepsOnly { };
+            workspaceBuild = craneLib.buildWorkspace {
+              cargoArtifacts = workspaceDeps;
+            };
+            flakebox-tutorial = craneLib.buildPackage { };
+          });
       in
       {
+        inherit legacyPackages;
+        packages.default = legacyPackages.flakebox-tutorial;
         devShells = flakeboxLib.mkShells {
           packages = [ ];
         };
```

Verify the Nix code is still OK:

```
> nix flake check
```

Now there is one thing missing: since we want reproduceable builds it is mandatory that we supply a `Cargo.lock` file to the build process to make sure we are know which versions of the dependencies to compile.

```
> cargo update
> git add -N Cargo.lock
```

`git add -N <pathspec>` records the intend to add this file to a commit in the future, adding it to gits view. This is needed as nix only looks for files that git is aware of.

Let's check if it works:

```
> nix build .#dev.flakebox-tutorial
warning: Git tree '/home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial' is dirty
> file result/bin/flakebox-tutorial 
result/bin/flakebox-tutorial: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /nix/store/46m4xx889wlhsdj72j38fnlyyvvvvbyb-glibc-2.37-8/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.10.0, not stripped
> ./result/bin/flakebox-tutorial 
Hello, world!
```

Tada! It's working! `nix build` creates a `result/` symlink in the current directory pointing the result of the requested derivation (build output in non-Nix).

Good time to add `result/` to `.gitignore`:

```
> hx .gitignore
> cat .gitignore 
/target
/result
```

Commit the current state and I can explain in more details what is
this new Nix code is doing and what else you can do with it (spoiler: cross-compilation and different cargo build profiles!).


```
> git commit -a -m "build: Add initial build system"
Skipping semgrep check: .config/semgrep.yaml empty

 1 file changed, 30 insertions(+)
```

## Building Rust code with Flakebox - explanation

Let's discuss each part of the code:

```
        flakeboxLib = flakebox.lib.${system} { };
```

`let ... in <expr>` in Nix is used to bind values
to names, that can later be used in `<expr>` following
in.

Our first name binding is `flakeboxLib` which exposes all
Flakebox APIs. `flakebox` is the name of the input
defined in the flake, `flakebox.lib.${system}` is
the library output it exposes for the current `system`.
`flakebox.lib.${system} { }` is a function call, where
`{ }` are the arguments (empty set, defaults).

This is where you can enable/disable/configure various features of flakebox. A list of config options can be found [here](./nixos-options.md)

The next binding is:

```nix
        rustSrc = flakeboxLib.filterSubPaths {
          root = builtins.path {
            name = "flakebox-tutorial";
            path = ./.;
          };
          paths = [
            "Cargo.toml"
            "Cargo.lock"
            ".cargo"
            "src"
          ];
        };
```

This `filterSubPaths` is a function exposed by
`flakeboxLib` and is used for easy source code filtering.
This is useful to avoid having to rebuild our Rust project
when only irrelevant files changed. It's not strictly
necessary, but almost any project will benefit
from avoiding redoing work when it's not necessary.
As `Nix` doesn't understand the details of how
`cargo` works, the only way to explain it which
files can change the result of a build is by
filtering them out. The details of source code filtering
will be explained elsewhere in the documentation.


The last name binding is:

```nix
        legacyPackages = (flakeboxLib.craneMultiBuild { }) (craneLib':
          let
            craneLib = (craneLib'.overrideArgs {
              pname = "flakebox-tutorial";
              src = rustSrc;
            });
          in
          rec {
            workspaceDeps = craneLib.buildWorkspaceDepsOnly { };
            workspaceBuild = craneLib.buildWorkspace {
              cargoArtifacts = workspaceDeps;
            };
            flakebox-tutorial = craneLib.buildPackage { };
          });
```


`(flakeboxLib.craneMultiBuild { })` is a function call of `craneMultiBuild` function
with an empty set `{ }` as an argument. This function is meant for conveniently
building Rust across cargo build profiles and toolchains.

It returns a function that must be called with ... another function as an argument.
You can see why functional programming is called, well, functional.

The rest of this code block `(craneLib': /* ... */ });` is the actual build
function. The `craneLib'` is the the [crane](https://crane.dev/) library instance
already pre-configured for the caller requested environment.

[crane](https://crane.dev/) is a Nix library for building `cargo` projects.
It might feel a little bit intimidating at first, but I encourage you to
read [crane's Introduction pages](https://crane.dev/introduction.html)
(all of them).

Notably `craneLib` is already pre-configured for you, so you might notice
that in our example we don't need to pass as many examples. Also,
Flakebox enhanced `crane` with certain extra functionality for
even more convenient use.

The following
```nix
            let
              craneLib = (craneLib'.overrideArgs {
                pname = "flexbox-multibuild";
                src = rustSrc;
              });
            in
```

defines a new name binding. The value of it is the original `craneLib'`
with certain arguments overridden. `pname` sets the name of the derivation
and `src` sets the source directory for `crane` to build.

Finally:

```nix
            rec {
              workspaceDeps = craneLib.buildWorkspaceDepsOnly { };
              workspaceBuild = craneLib.buildWorkspace {
                cargoArtifacts = workspaceDeps;
              };
              flakebox-tutorial = craneLib.buildPackage { };
            }
```

defines a set with 3 derivations.

`flakebox-tutorial` corresponds to `cargo build` and taking all the
resulting binaries as the result of the whole derivation.

`workspaceBuild` corresponds to `cargo build --workspace`, but notably
it's result (output) is the whole `./target` directory after `cargo`
completed. It also uses `cargoArtifacts = workspaceDeps;` which means
it doesn't start from scratch, but instead takes the result of `workspaceDeps`
and uses it as starting point (`./target` content to be precise).

`workspaceDeps` uses a crane's special sauce "deps only" build which
compiles only the dependencies of the whole workspace. This way
the resulting `./target/` doesn't need to get rebuild unless
project dependencies changed, which improves the caching by a lot.


The result of this whole call to `craneMultiBuild` is bound in `legacyPackages` name
and conceptually contains a matrix of all supported cargo build profiles and
supported toolchains:

* `<output>` - i.e. `workspaceDeps`, `workspaceBuild`, `flakebox-tutorial` are builds using default (`release`) building profile and `default` (native) toolchain
* `<profile>.<output>` - e.g. `dev.workspaceDeps`, `release.workspaceBuild`, `ci.flakebox-tutorial` are builds using `<ci>` building profile and `default` (native) toolchain
* `<toolchain>.<profile>.<output>` - e.g. `nightly.dev.workspaceDeps`, `aarch64-android.release.flakebox-tutorial` are builds using `<ci>` build profile and `<toolchain>`

By default `dev`, `ci`, and `release` profiles are available, and `default`, `stable`, `nightly` are the native toolchains, and cross-compilation toolchains include:

* `aarch64-android`
* `arm-android`
* `x86_64-android`
* `i686-android`
* `aarch64-darwin`
* `x86_64-darwin`
* `aarch64-linux`

Please be aware that some of these toolchains will take a very long time to actually compile.

Finally

```nix
        inherit legacyPackages;
```

exposes all these outputs as a "legacy packages" in our Flake. It's a bit of a hack, but will work for now.

This

```nix
        packages.default = legacyPackages.flakebox-tutorial;
```

can be used to expose select outputs as normal flake packages.

## Building Rust code with Flakebox - practice


Try to build the cod now:

```
> nix build .#flakebox-tutorial
20:18:37 ~/tmp/flakebox-tutorial  master [?] is 📦 v0.1.0 🦀v1.72.0 ❄️ 
> file result/bin/flakebox-tutorial
result/bin/flakebox-tutorial: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /nix/store/46m4xx889wlhsdj72j38fnlyyvvvvbyb-glibc-2.37-8/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.10.0, not stripped
```

The above is the release build using the default (native `stable`) toolchain.

Now build the whole workspace using `dev` mode of `nightly` toolchain and keep the whole output (`-L`):

```

```

As you can see the `result` contains the actual compressed `target.tar.zst`. Well, the incremental layer of new/changed files and a link to a previous layer, to be precise.

The cross-compilation parts assume you're using x86-64 Linux system. If that's not the case, especially if you
are on MacOS, some things might require some tweaking or not work. Sorry.

Try cross-compiling:

```
> nix build .#aarch64-android.dev.flakebox-tutorial
> file result/bin/flakebox-tutorial
result/bin/flakebox-tutorial: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
```

Yes. This is our tutorial project cross-compiled to aarch64 android. Just like that.


### Extra dependencies

Compiling a "hello world" project might seem too easy, so pretend there
are some nontrivial dependencies that need to be compiled as well:

```
> cargo add openssl
# ...
> cargo add libsqlite3-sys
# ...
```

Both of these dependencies are rather non-trivial, as they use C bindings, etc.

Try building them:

```
> cargo build
  --- stderr
  thread 'main' panicked at '

  Could not find directory of OpenSSL installation, and this `-sys` crate cannot
  proceed without this knowledge. If OpenSSL is installed and this crate had
  trouble finding it,  you can set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable for the
  compilation process.

  Make sure you also have the development packages of openssl installed.
  For example, `libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora.

  If you're in a situation where you think the directory *should* be found
  automatically, please open a bug at https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl
  and include information about your system as well as this message.

```

Note that you don't have to use `nix build` all the time when working on your project.
When working locally, it's more convenient to rely on the tooling that you
are familiar with running in a dev shell.

Anyway - the compilation failed because it can't find native OpenSSL.

Add the necessary build inputs and re-enter the dev shell:

Does the Android build still works too?

Yes, it does!

Commit:

```


and let's try the "cross shell".

## Cross-compilation dev shell

Remember: **when working locally you should use dev shells to
provide complete and reproducible development environment and
NOT invoke `nix build` for everything.**

While `nix build` and Nix derivations are great, they do introduce
an overhead and can't reason about your project as well as
`cargo` can.

But as things are currently, we can only compile our project
using native toolchain in dev shell, and we need to use `craneMultiBuild`
and `nix build` to cross-compile.

This is when so called "cross-shell" comes into play. The reason
the cross-shell is not a default shell is that - unlike `nix build .#<target>...` which
downloads toolchains on demand - it requires bringing in all the supported cross-compiling
toolchains upfront. This can cost gigabytes of downloaded data and storage,
while most developers for most projects will not need it.

 The default cross shell enabled only the relatively lightweight toolchains like Android ones, which use pre-built binaries SDK toolchains of the Android project.
At least you don't need to compile them from scratch.
 
 Enter the 'cross' shell:
 
 ```
 > nix develop .#cross
 ```
 
 (this might take a moment).
 
 And build the project:
 
 ```
 > cargo build --target aarch64-linux-android
   Compiling vcpkg v0.2.15
# ...
   Compiling openssl-sys v0.9.93
   Compiling openssl-macros v0.1.1
   Compiling flakebox-tutorial v0.1.0 (/home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 5.77s
> file target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/flakebox-tutorial
target/aarch64-linux-android/debug/flakebox-tutorial: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
> cargo build --target x86_64-linux-android
   Compiling libc v0.2.148
# ...
   Compiling openssl v0.10.57
   Compiling foreign-types v0.3.2
   Compiling flakebox-tutorial v0.1.0 (/home/dpc/tmp/flakebox-tutorial)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.44s
> file target/x86_64-linux-android/debug/flakebox-tutorial
target/x86_64-linux-android/debug/flakebox-tutorial: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, with debug_info, not stripped
```

it just works.

Please be aware that cross-compilation is notorious tricky.
Certain combinations of host and target architectures might not work,
some dependencies might require non-trivial custom settings
and workarounds. But with Flakebox at very least you're starting
from good defaults and you can share the work and the results
with the community. And with Nix while it works, it will
keep working.

Flakebox does support building setting up custom toolchains from
scratch, but it's outside of the scope of this tutorial.

Project can define multiple (cross-) dev shells, that include
different tools and toolchains for different tasks. It's common
that web-developers would only be interested in wasm toolchain,
and mobile developers would only be interested in the Android toolchains.

## Summary

This concludes this tutorial. If you feel adventurous and have
CPU cycles to burn, try:

```
> nix build -L .#aarch64-linux.dev.flakebox-tutorial
```

and see how long does it take to build a `aarch64-linux` toolchain
on your system.
